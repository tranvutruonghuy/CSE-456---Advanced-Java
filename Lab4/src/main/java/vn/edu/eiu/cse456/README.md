Discussion: Layered Design Evaluation
1. Is the layered design reasonable? Yes, the layered design is reasonable and effective for a small-to-medium scale application. It clearly separates concerns:
- Presentation Layer handles user interaction and orchestration.
- Service Layer encapsulates business logic.
- Data Layer defines payment strategies and implementations.
  This structure promotes maintainability, testability, and scalability.
2. Suggested Improvements:
   While the current design is solid, here are a few enhancements for larger or more complex systems:
- Add an Interface for the Service Layer: This allows mocking and easier testing.
- Use a DI Framework: For example, Spring or Jakarta CDI can manage dependencies more flexibly.
- Introduce a Factory or Strategy Pattern: To dynamically select payment methods based on runtime conditions.
- Validation Layer: Add input validation before processing payments.
- Logging and Exception Handling: Centralize error handling and logging for better observability.
